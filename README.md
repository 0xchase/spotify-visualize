# spotify-visualize
Visualize my spotify playlists.

Use force directed graph library like [force-graph](https://github.com/vasturiano/force-graph), react-vis, apex charts, apache echarts, etc. Check out [this](https://echarts.apache.org/examples/en/editor.html?c=global-wind-visualization&gl=1) cool visualization.

## Ideas
 - Word cloud of playlist names
 - Bar/line chart of song popularity and other features
 - Bar chart of songs per genre in playlists
 - Dot plot of song popularity
 - Directed graph of genres?
